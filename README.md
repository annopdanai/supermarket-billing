# supermarket-billing
Project for KMITL Software Engineering Year 1 Semester 1
## Project Description
We are willing to make a supermarket billing program for giving service both user side and admin side. For users, they can buy the products which each of the products will be shown to them, so they can input how much/many do they want to buy and, then after all goods have been dealt by the users, the total cost will be printed to inform the users how much amount of money would cost them. On the adminsâ€™ side, they are allowed to change the price of any product and be able to add or delete list of things would be sold at this supermarket.
